# Hello, React.

I don't think I've learned a programming language library before. Maybe I dibble-dabbled in JQuery, if that's a JS library, but I certainly don't remember it. So I won't count that. And the vibe I get surfing the interwebs tells me that JQuery is **OUT** and React is **IN**. So here I go, learning React, a JavaScript library to make user interfaces snappy and snazzy (from what I gather anyway). 

## Initial Reactions

I am actually quite excited to learn React, and here's why: 

My programming/coding journey has ebbed and flowed for nearly a decade now, and what usually happens after I pick something up after a months-long break, is I just have to relearn a bunch of stuff I once knew. And relearning stuff is considerably easier than learning new stuff, right? So after relearning bits of Python, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each at least three times now, it's all mostly familiar and I feel pretty confident when I hop back into writing basic code in any of these languages. 

**Enter React.** The first couple nights of learning React, I have this recently unfamiliar feeling of confusion! I am out of my coding comfort zone that I guess I've unintentially been stuck in for too long now.

## Reflections on How React Works

***A virtual DOM?*** Ok, I know what a DOM is, so things are sorta familiar there.

***JSX?*** JavaScript eXtension, but it looks too much like HTML. Ok, weird, but fine.

***Data Models???*** Ok, now this is starting to feel a bit too abstract, at least initially. So parts of the user interface are now being represented as data models? Which then will make them update/change/(dis)appear much quicker? I think I need to see this in action to really get a feel for this. Data models are probably where most of my initial confustion comes from.

Oh, but wait! Something familiar to me! **curly braces** for attributes and expressions! I feel some comfort there because the curly braces remind me of templating languages, like Jinja which I've used with Django, or Nunjucks which I've used when building sites with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (like this one!).

Not terribly excting yet, but stay tuned...
